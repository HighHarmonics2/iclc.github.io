We are accepting paper submissions for the following categories:

* Long papers (6-12 pages)
* Short papers (4-6 pages)
* Poster/demo papers (2-4 pages)
* Workshop (300 words)

All submissions must use the conference template and follow the
instructions within, available in both Microsoft Word and Markdown
formats. Download the [latest version
here](https://github.com/livecodenetwork/templates/archive/master.zip),
as a zipfile.

All submissions must be in PDF format, and submitted via Easychair.

ICLC is an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches
are encouraged and we recognise that the appropriate length of a paper
may vary considerably depending on the approach. However, all
submissions must propose an original contribution to Live Coding
research, cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research
methods.

The proceedings will be published with ISSN, and there will also be an
follow-on opportunity to contribute to a special issue of the Journal
on Performance Arts and Digital Media; details will be announced soon.

## Themes

The following long list of topics, contributed by early career researchers in the field, are indicative of the breadth of research we wish to include:

* Live coding and the body; tangibility, gesture, embodiment
* Creative collaboration through live code
* Live coding in education, teaching and learning
* Live coding terminology and the cognitive dimensions of notation
* Live language and interface design
* CUIs: Code as live user interface
* Domain specific languages, and the live coding ecosystem
* Programming language experience design: visualising live process and state in code interfaces
* Virtuosity, flow, aesthetics and phenomenology of live code
* Live coding: composition, improvisation or something else?
* Time in notation, process, and perception
* Live coding of and inside computer games and virtual reality
* Live programming languages as art: esoteric and idiosyncratic systems
* Bugfixing in/as performance
* Individual expression in shared live coding environments
* Live coding across the senses and algorithmic synaesthesia
* Audience research and ethnographies of live coding
* Live coding without computers
* Live coding before Live Coding; historical perspectives on live programming languages
* Heritage, vintage and nostalgia â€“ bringing the past to life with code
* Live coding in public and in private
* Cultural processes of live programming language design
* General purpose live programming languages and live coding operating systems
* Connecting live coding with ancient arts or crafts practice
* Live coding and the hacker/maker movement: DIY and hacker aesthetics
* Critical reflections; diversity in the live coding community
* The freedom of liveness, and free/open source software
