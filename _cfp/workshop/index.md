As part of the International Conference for Live Coding we are interested in including exciting and diverse workshops focusing on particular ideas, methods and themes around live coding. Have you developed a technique, language or a system? Is your work in robotics, graphics, games, dance, installations, performance art, interface design, video art or music using some live coding methods that could be fun to introduce to other people? Would you be interested in involving others in the exploration or even development of your system? Then please submit a 300 word abstract with your proposal for a half-day workshop.
 
Describe the space and technical support required for you to run your workshop. We are able to accommodate four parallel workshops, which will take place during 13th of July, the first day of the conference. Please use the "short paper" submission category on EasyChair for submitting your workshop.
