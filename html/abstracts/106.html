<h2 class="title">Physical Livecoding with littleBits</h2>

<h3 class="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>littleBits (littleBits.cc) is an open-source hardware library of pre-assembled analogue components that can be easily assembled into circuits, disassembled, reassembled, and re-used. In this demonstration, we will show how littleBits --- and the KORG littleBits SynthKit in particular --- can be considered a physically-embodied domain specific programming language, and thus how assembling or improvising music with littleBits circuits is a tangible form of livecoding.</p>
