<h3 class="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>We describe research extending the live coding environment Gibber with affordances for ensemble, networked, live coding performances. These include shared editing of code documents, remote code execution, an extensible chat system, shared state, and clock synchronization via proportional-integral control. We discuss these features using the framework provided by Lee and Essl in their 2014 paper <em>Models and Opportunities for Networked Live Coding</em>.</p>
