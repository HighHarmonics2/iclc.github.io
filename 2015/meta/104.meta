One of the Grace implementations, Hopper, is an interpreter that runs on top of JavaScript. Gibber is series of libraries that support real-time audio processing, and also a simple livecoding interactive development environment, also on top of JavaScript. In this demonstration, we will present Gribber, a web-based IDE that incorporates the Hopper interpreter into the Gibber IDE, and so gives Grace live access to the Gibber audio libraries. Because of Hopper's continuation-passing design, Gribber programs can appear multi-threaded, apparently running one or more loops in parallel, each pseudo-thread generating sound and graphics in simultaneously. We will demonstrate how Gribber can be used for BALSA-style algorithm animation, and Sorting Out Sorting style algorithm races.<br /><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19352"><img src="/images/doi/10.5281/zenodo.19352.svg"/></a><hr />
