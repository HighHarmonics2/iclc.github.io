<h2>Giovanni Mori. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19343">Analysing Live Coding with Ethnographical Approach</a></h2><p>In this article, I will analyse live coding technique under the magnifying lens of Ethnography. Using this
perspective, I will try to delve into three main aspects: the effect on the audience/performer interaction of
the screen projection during performances; the relationship between “hacker’s ethic”, borrowing a Pekka
Himanen’s definition, and live coders community; how some researchers are trying to establish contacts
between formal and informal music milieu. In my view, an Ethnographical approach can help people
interested in live coding to contextualise some implication of this technique’s internal dynamics.
Additionally, this perspective can be useful to build a bridge between some academic and non-academic
computer music contexts, using live coding as glue between them.<br /><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19343"><img src="/images/doi/10.5281/zenodo.19343.svg"/></a><hr />  </body>
