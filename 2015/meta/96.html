<h2>Antonio D. Carvalho Jr, Sang Won Lee and Georg Essl. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19347">SuperCopair: Collaborative Live Coding on Supercollider through the cloud</a></h2><p>In this work we present the SuperCopair package, which is a new way to integrate cloud computing into a collaborative live coding scenario with minimum efforts in the setup. This package, created in Coffee Script for Atom.io, is developed to interact with SuperCollider and provide opportunities for the crowd of online live coders to collaborate remotely on distributed performances. Additionally, the package provides the advantages of cloud services offered by Pusher. Users can share code and evaluate lines or selected portions of code on computers connected to the same session, either at the same place and/or remotely. The package can be used for remote performances or rehearsal purposes with just an Internet connection to share code and sounds. In addition, users can take advantage of code sharing to teach SuperCollider online or fix bugs in the algorithm.<br /><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19347"><img src="/images/doi/10.5281/zenodo.19347.svg"/></a><hr />  </body>
