<h1>From Live Coding to Virtual Being</h1><h2>Nikolai Suslov and Tatiana Soshenina</h2><p>The self-explorative, collaborative environments and virtual worlds are setting up the new standards in software engineering for today. In this, live coding is also required in reviewing as for programmers and as for artists too. The most popular live coding frameworks, even being built by using highly dynamic, reflective languages, still suffer on tight bindings to single-node or client-server architecture, language or platform dependence and third-party tools. That leads to inability nor to develop nor scale to the Internet of things the new created works using live coding. In the paper we introduce the prototype of integration of object-oriented language for pattern matching OMeta onto Virtual World Framework on JavaScript. That integration will allow using the live coding in virtual worlds with user-defined languages. Also we explore the possibilities of a conformal scaling of live coding in the case of augmented reality systems and Internet of things. In summary, the paper describes the efforts being done for involving virtual worlds architecture in live coding process. All prototypes that are described in the paper are available for experimenting with on Krestianstvo SDK open source project: http://www.krestianstvo.org<br /><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19353"><img src="/images/doi/10.5281/zenodo.19353.svg"/></a><hr />  </body>
