                <p>Definitions of live coding provided by some of the ICLC registrants:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing code where the feedback cycle of instructions is close to real-time</li>
<li>live coding is creating changeable art with changeable text instructions</li>
<li>Editing textual code with immediate results.</li>
<li>a contested set of practices that explore the computer as a (sonic) time machine with emergent properties </li>
<li>Editing a running program such that the edits take a potentially immediate effect</li>
<li>Writing (visible) code during the performance, this may be inside a framework or consist of prepared snippets,  but it can be changed on the fly to improvise
a form of self expression aided by real-time feedback from programming environments</li>
<li>Making software as a performance</li>
<li>Coming from a musical standpoint; The use of programming via text/language to create, modify and articulate ideas/processes as a performative gesture.</li>
<li>writing and manipulating code as the (primary) interface for live performance or rehearsal.</li>
<li>redefinable</li>
<li>Sculpting realtime algorithms</li>
<li>Improvised performance which includes the writing and/or editing of a generative rule set.</li>
<li>Acts of expression and communication that involve the creation, modification and display of codes.</li>
<li>live coding = virtual being</li>
<li>the performance of programming</li>
<li>A technique used to make the computer do a process in real time</li>
<li>Dynamic interaction between the coder(s) and the machine.</li>
<li>Use of a programming language to generate music or visuals in a live performance context</li>
<li>the real time scripting game</li>
<li>For me live coding is the joy of collective experience of digital music, in the middle of a more &quot;lonely listening&quot; experience of music proposed by most of digital devices.<br></li>
<li>Live coding is write and/or modify algorithmic procedures on-the-fly, bound for creating any kind of process-event; it comes to an intellectual and sensible exchange, a celebration of risk and change, a conversation that provides access to thought.</li>
<li>The planned flow of the unexpected</li>
<li>Write code in front of people.</li>
<li>Live creation and manipulation of sound (or other)-producing graphs.</li>
<li>on the fly events generation by code scripting</li>
<li>to modify a computer program while it is running.</li>
<li>writing code in front of an audience who can see the relationship between changes to the code and changes in some form output, usually music or live visuals. </li>
<li>A musical instrument like any other, with its own peculiarities and way of playing.</li>
<li>the interactive control of algorithmic processes through programming activity</li>
<li>Creative expression mediated through a coding language in front of an audience</li>
<li>Live coding is for me a way to explore, on a very much hands-on way, the creative potential from computers, humans and algorithms combined. It is a door to a sort of third space where the rules can be redefined.</li>
<li>A Cybernetic human-machine system (the HC interface is a conceptual/physical boundary between component parts of the system)</li>
<li>feeding symbols with meanings into interpreting (machine) systems in real-time for translation into music/visual performance signs</li>
<li>a real-time action, including instructions </li>
<li>coding (music/sound) in real time, while listening assessing and feeding back appropriate code.</li>
<li>A broad description of live performance of computer music or analog music using computer.</li>
<li>Writing the code that produces the performance during the performance itself.  The code may start from 0 (nothing, scratch), or there may be pre-written parts to be executed.  But always there is the choice of what to execute at a given moment, and the code is at least modified during the performance. </li>
<li>live algorithmic performance</li>
<li>LiveCoding: (Mexican def.) The action of programming making it creative by drinking some mezcal.</li>
<li>Live Coding is the use of knowledge for the realization of a sound or visual idea through the computer.</li>
<li>Real time electronic music structuring</li>
<li>Live Coding = Virtual Being</li>
<li>An interactive programming often used to create digital media such as music with improvisation.</li>
<li>Can I come back and edit this answer later? (Note, this is my definition, not a question. Well, actually both.)</li>
<li>Writing code during sound/image/text performance and as a contributory and necessary part of it</li>
<li>A very open form of engaging with interpreters through code - resistant to definitions - playful -  fun - never to be defined.</li>
<li>Using code as a form of expression.</li>
<li>algorithmic composition created on the spot</li>
<li>while true { edit(); experience(); enjoy(); }</li>
<li>conscious choices of determinism and indeterminism in a live performance</li>
<li>&quot;Live Coding is about (live) process in general, reveals the process of production and uses production as a performance element. As a visual artist/performer I am more interested in the (open) process of art/performance/music production rather than the (closed) final product. In the context of Open Source I share the belief that processes of production should not be hidden.</li>
<li>Live Coding with or without computer programming/source code often draws on rhythmic patterns and audio/sound/movement elements edited through improvisation and intuition. &quot;</li>
<li>IT&#39;S COOL.</li>
<li>life coding</li>
<li>Responding to an environment</li>
<li>Computer-mediated interaction with multi-sensory performance.</li>
<li>Programming as performance.</li>
<li>fluid development at the speed of thought</li>
<li>Writing code without the requirement to lip-sync.</li>
<li>A feedback loop involving the insertion of code into a running process, which then changes, and causes new responses, which in turn stimulates the insertion of further code and so on.</li>
<li>Pre-arranged coding on the spot during a performance</li>
<li>as something that will always outstrip my attempts to define it</li>
<li>thinking while diving</li>
<li>Personal toll and understanding with God</li>
<li>Hearing and seeing on projectors or tv shows live the words and instructions from God through pastor Chris our papa</li>
<li>The use of programming languages to compose and perform music, usually to an audience that can view the information on the screen</li>
<li>Run time is all the time.</li>
<li>Spontaneous and synergistic generation of digital control structures</li>
<li>The act and process of producing creative sounds or visuals by programming.</li>
<li>not live codding</li>
