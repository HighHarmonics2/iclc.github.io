<h2 class="title">Performative Code: Strategies for Live Coding Graphics</h2>

Shawn Lawson (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)<br />


<h3 class="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Performing real-time, live coded graphics requires a streamlined programming environment, efficient implementation techniques, improvisatory inventiveness, a tuned ear, and above all, aesthetic sensibility. The performer must not only pull together these concepts, but maintain an awareness and forethought, of the graphical results of and performance expectations of the live coding environment.</p>
