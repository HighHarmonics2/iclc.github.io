<h3 class="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>very long cat are a new network music duo combining tabla and live coding, rehearsing and performing via the Internet, and employing an eclectic range of techniques and technologies. The specific structure of the ensemble’s network music setup, with one musician live coding and monitoring their own performance with a calibrated delay, allows both musicians to experience each other’s performances as synchronized. This poster focuses on the evolving technical configuration of this hybrid ensemble, with an emphasis on the constraints imposed by the insistence on “zero latency” in a live coding ensemble (some sound transformations are not feasible, and others are implemented in a characteristic way).</p>
