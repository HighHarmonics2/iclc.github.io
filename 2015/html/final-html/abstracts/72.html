<h2 class="title">Embodiment of code</h2>

<h3 class="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The code we read on the screens of a livecoding performance is an expression of our compositional concepts. In this paper I reflect on the practice of livecoding from the concept of embodiment as proposed by <span class="citation">Varela, Thompson, and Rosch (1991)</span>: how we as coders embody the code, how machines can embody code, and how we inevitably need to deal with the physicality of the machines and our own bodies that we use in our performances, and how we adapt both our machines and bodies to enable our performances.</p>
