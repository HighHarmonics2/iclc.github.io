            <h4>Mechanical Techno / TidalCycles hybrid set by G. Dunning</h4>
              <p>Graham Dunning uses TidalCycles alongside his Mechanical Techno contraption in an unconventional hybrid
                performance, which allows room for error, inconsistency and play. The performance highlights similarities
                in visual and sonic presentation between the two different approaches.</p>
            <a name="pn2"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Coding in atypical places by M. Cortés and I. Abreu</h4>
              <p>Live cinema coding, experimental music and motion typographics of the code edited live. Cinemato-graphic and
                sound collage of unfinished expressions of the idea of the future in Mexico City. The project is created with
                the algorithmic possibilities of TidalCycles and Processing, the premiere of this live act took place in the
                last edition of Mutek Montreal 2018.</p>
            <a name="pn3"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Audiovisual Roulette by Cybernetic Orchestra</h4>
              <p>The Cybernetic Orchestra is a participatory live coding ensemble that employs a shifting and heterogenous
                mix of languages and configurations to make music. Multi-linguality and collaborative interfaces and practices
                have become definitional for the group. For ICLC 2019 we propose a double roulette in which orchestra members
                will take turns modifying either notations that produce music or notations that produce generative visuals
                in conjunction with that music. Our performance will use the Estuary web-based platform, and showcase new and
                developing features of that platform, including but not limited to: the Punctual language for live coding
                synthesis graphs, new notations for generative visuals, graphical interfaces that blur the line between text
                programming and GUI-style interaction, responsive and assistive displays, etc.</p>
            <a name="pn4"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Safeguard</h4>
              <p>Safeguard is an autonomous live-coded performance. The performer is a machine learning algorithm, ​Cibo​, trained
                to perform (read, change, execute, and repeat) Tidal code. ​Cibo was trained on sequences of Tidal code, in this way,
                the implementation of the algorithm has no knowledge of ​sound. ​This separation of code and sound resulted in a trained
                algorithm that recognizes how a human performer would change their code from the human’s perception of sound. Even
                at this early stage of development several intriguing personified occurrences have cropped up. Further details,
                implementation methods, and philosophical musings of this research are in our paper submission.
                We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Titan Xp GPU used for this research.</p>

              <h4>Street Code</h4>
              <p>Street Code is a series of performances of live coded electroacoustic music in public, half public, and/or open
                space. It is about taking electroacoustic music from its usual venues and bringing it to unexpected places where
                it can enter in dialogue with the city space, both physical and social, and with the architecture of the city.
                Finding nice spots to play where the sound could be interesting, and the projection of the codes painting the
                walls with musical scores of light created on the fly is what Street Code is all about.<br/>
                Street Code is a performance for one or many live coders, for a stage, for a tree, for a street, for an alley,
                park, or subway station. With a huge sound system or a small usb speaker and for any duration of time.</p>
            <a name="pn6"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Círculo e Meio (Circle and Half) by J. Chicau and R. Bell</h4>
              <p>An Audio-Visual Live Coding Performance Combining Choreographic Thinking and Algorithmic Improvisation.<br /><br />
                This piece choreographs the movements in graphic and sound design carried out by human and non-human performers interacting
                on themes of hybridity, circulation, and the permeability of language. By adding software agents, the piece expands a
                previous composition for two improvising performers, one live coding a browser window and another live coding audio, which
                used the circle as a base choreographic concept for how we perceive relationships between users, software agents, the
                computing environment, and society at large. We also extended a shared vocabulary to include these concepts and have
                moved from strictly dynamic percussive sounds and vocal that evoke sensations of vibration, rhythm, fast movement to
                include fluid-like sounds and images, harmony, gradients, mixed non-linear horizontal and vertical arrangements, and
                other related elements.<br />
                The length of the performance has been extended from the originally presented at the International Live Interfaces
                Conference 2018 [1]; and will be excerpted to match the constraints of this conference.</p>
            <a name="pn7"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>SquareFuck by M. Caliman</h4>
              <p>A performance that extends the live coding act to outside of the software IDE, by integrating real time assembly and
                manipulation of electronic circuits to the traditional “show us your screen” code display, while live coding Arduino
                boards and physically manipulating speakers. squareFuck unveils a process of failure. The inability to perform a task is,
                ultimately, the unwillingness to leave things behind.</p>
            <a name="pn8"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Off<>zzing the CKalcuƛator by A. Veinberg and F. Noriega</h4>
              <p>The CKalcuƛator is a lambda-calculus arithmetic calculator for the piano. It is the fourth sub-system of the CodeKlavier
                project whose goal is to become a domain specific programming language that enables a pianist to live code by playing
                the piano (Veinberg and Ignacio 2018).<br />
                In this performance, duo Off<>zz - Felipe Ignacio Noriega (live coding) and Anne Veinberg (piano), will give a performance
                in their standard formation of live coding in SuperCollider and piano playing but with the adjustment of Veinberg using
                the CKalcuƛator system and thus composing and evaluating simple arithmetic operations and number comparisons with her
                piano playing. The results of these operations are broadcast via OSC, enabling the laptop to utilize them as a
                combination of number values, boolean switches, audio input and conditions for the live coded algorithms.</p>
            <a name="pn9"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Etudes pour live coding a une main by M. Baalman</h4>
              <p>Typing is one the main physical skills involved in text-based livecoding. The ‘classical’ interface for this is the
                ‘qwerty’-keyboard for 10 finger blind typing. In search for an alternative interface allowing to get away from the
                laptop, but still code via a text interface, I came across the commercial Twiddler one-handed (twelve-button) keyboard.
                To learn how to use it, I needed practice materials to study the chording for writing code and created an interface that
                allows for playback of recorded livecoding scripts, which I then need to type and execute line by line. The interface
                is available at https://github.com/sensestage/SuperColliderTwiddler.<br />
                At this ICLC, I will perform from a script of RedFrik’s performance “Livecoded supercollider, well practiced” at the
                LOSS Livecode Festival in Sheffield on July 20th, 2007, as found on Fredrik Olofsson’s website
                (https://www.fredrikolofsson.com/f0blog/?q=node/155). To make the script suitable for performance in 2019 within the
                etude-environment, minor adjustments were made in the code to ensure that it would execute and to reduce the line
                length to fit into the graphical interface.</p>

              <h4>Moving Patterns by K. Sicchio</h4>
              <p>Moving Patterns is a duet for dancer and coder. It allows a visual score for the dancer to be created in real time
                through the Haskell based live coding language TidalCycles and special image language DanceDirt. The audience sees the
                performers react and change to the score as it develops through coding and movement on stage.</p>
            <a name="pn11"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Scorpion Mouse: Exploring Hidden Spaces by J. Levine and M. Cheung</h4>
              <p>Scorpion Mouse is a duo that explores how algorithmic music and a live vocalist can have a symbiotic relationship and
                improvise together. May improvises over the music livecoded by Jason. Jason gets his phrasing cues, dynamics, and transitions
                from May’s singing. Similarly, information from Jason’s livecoding system is sent to May’s digital voice processor so that
                rhythmic and harmonic effects are in time and in key with the livecoded music, while the amplitude May’s voice affects the
                amplitude and filtering of the livecoded beats so that there is space while she is singing, and so the beats are full force
                when she is not. In this way Scorpion Mouse are free to explore vast musical territories while maintaining organic unity.<br />
                Musically, Scorpion Mouse has influences from electronic styles like trance, drum and bass, IDM, and ambient as well as
                influences from electric styles like jazz, soul, rock and pop. Their music is built from three layers: On the bottom, rhythmically
                complex percussive beats. In the middle, lush synth harmonies, and on top, ethereal melodic vocals.</p>
            <a name="pn12"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Transit; is worse than the flood by J. Forero</h4>
              <p>Transit is an audiovisual work for live coding. Transit explores computer and cultural processes, which are created and
                destroyed from their definition, in words or codes, and are transformed in time, by their diverse interactions. The work
                is inspired, in particular, in Lakutaia Lekipa ́s life, known as the last woman carrier of the Yaganes language and
                traditions, pre-Hispanic culture of the extreme south of Chile and Argentina. Thus, in a poetic exercise, the writings
                codes carry messages for the execution in real time of the sounds and graphics that build the multimedia sequences.</p>
            <a name="pn13"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Supercontinent by D. Ogborn, S. Knotts, E. Betancur, J. Rodriguez, A. Brown and A. Khoparzi</h4>
              <p>SuperContinent is an intercontinental live coding ensemble, with one member per continent. The ensemble rehearses online,
                via the evolving Estuary platform for collaborative live coding, bringing together artists of quite different
                sensibilities and exposing the distinctive requirements of live coding ensembles that are highly and definitionally
                geographically distributed. Our ICLC 2019 performance will bring together the live coding of patterns, the live coding
                of synthesis graphs (via the new Punctual language for live coding), and the live coding of generative visuals.</p>
            <a name="pn14"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Live coding with crowdsourced sounds & a drum machine by A. Xambó</h4>
              <p>The access to crowdsourced digital sound content is becoming a valuable resource for music creation and particularly
                music performance. However, finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges, such as finding
                suitable sounds in real time and using them in a meaningful musical way. These challenges can be approached using music
                information retrieval (MIR) techniques. In this session, the self-built system MIRLC (Music Information Retrieval Live
                Coding), a SuperCollider extension, will be used to access audio content from the online Creative Commons (CC) sound
                database Freesound. The use of high-level MIR methods is possible (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues). This live
                audio stream of soundscapes from crowdsourced audio material will be combined with a vintage Roland MC-09 used as a drum
                machine.</p>
            <a name="pn15"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Livecoding temporal canons with Nanc-in-a-Can by A. Franco, D. Villaseñor and T. Sánchez</h4>
              <p>This performance will showcase the creative possibilities of Nanc-in-a-Can1, an open source SuperCollider
                library that we recently developed. Its main focus is the creation and modification of temporal canons (pioneered
                by Conlon Nancarrow) in a live and interactive setting. We will be exploring the formal and rhythmic aspects of the
                temporal canon form as well as the application of canonic data to sound synthesis and graphics generation, in order
                to generate timbral canonic structures that would be “voicing” our pitch based canons, thus generating canons
                within canons.
              </p>
            <a name="pn16"><br/><br/><br/></a>
              <h4>Contemporary Witchcraft by S. Knotts, S. Bahng and K. Cas </h4>
              <p><i>...that Enchantress who has thrown her magical spell around the most abstract of Sciences and has grasped it with a
                force which few masculine intellects (in our own country at least) could have exerted over it.</i> (Babbage, 1843)<br />
                Contemporary Witchcraft is a performance project by Project Group: a multimedia inter-continental feminist performance group.
                The performance combines sound, video and movement in a reflection on the interweaving of narratives on programming, women's
                bodies and mysticism. The performance is telematic with each performer located on a different continent: in Australia, Spain
                and South Korea.<br />
                Each performer transmits a different medium which the others respond to, to develop an improvised performance. Knotts live
                codes music, Cas uses motion tracking devices to transmit movement data and Bahng interweaves archive video footage with
                live video streams of Knotts and Cas performing. Cas and Bahng’s video streams are projected in the performance space
                alongside the code interface and audio of Knotts.<br />
                Narrative threads on programming, mysticism and digitally mediated embodiment act as stimulus to the improvisation,
                freely interwoven, meshed, meeting and diverging. The performance is condensed framework, a meeting of mediatised
                cultures, a relation between three mediated bodies distributed in space in a durational awakened process.</p>

              <h4>iCantuccini present: The Mandelbrots Experience by Benoit and the Mandelbrots</h4>
              <p>iCantuccini plays ‘Greatest Hits’ only! In <i>​The Mandelbrots Experience</i> they try to capture and recreate the original
                spirit of the live coding boy band <i>​Benoît and the Mandelbrots</i> in an unforgettable live show, performing all their
                rememberable tunes from The Mandelbrots 2016 Release. Get vegetal with <i>Gurke</i> (​Germanfor ‘carrot’) and enjoy the bright
                future envisioned in​ <i>Hello Tomorrow</i>​.<br /> Move your bodies to ​<i>Tranceposition</i> ​and ​<i>Tranceportation</i>  (​which sound awfully alike).
                Enjoy the retro-futuristic sounds of ​<i>Classic</i> or experience a stroll through the Mandelbrots’ hometown with ​<i>Karlsruhe</i> ​(‘Charles, remain!’)​.
                On top of the classic sound you’ll get the classic Mandelbrots look, the authentic stage outfits and the same visuals backdrop
                behind the code projection The Mandelbrots used without a change since 2012.<br />
                As iCantuccini cannot perform their full show at ICLC they will play a medley of the audience’s two favorite tracks.
                Select your favorites until under this URL and listen to the live coded recreation by the first Mandelbrots cover band
                ever (voting closes 5 minutes before the show).</p>
