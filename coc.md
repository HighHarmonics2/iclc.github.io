Our goal is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors,
with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are
committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all. We invite all those who participate in the conference, and the
community surrounding it, to help us create safe and positive
experiences for everyone.

Be aware of the effect your words may have on others. Do not insult
other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't
acceptable, including homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist or
sexist behaviour.
	
If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct,
you can get in touch with us either by:

Finding a member of the [organising team](/team.html) (they'll be
clearly identifiable) and let them know.

Dropping us an email at
[livecodenet@gmail.com](mailto:livecodenet@gmail.com).

We also welcome suggested edits to the above.
