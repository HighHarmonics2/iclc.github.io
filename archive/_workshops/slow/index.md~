## Slow coding, slow doing, slow listening, slow performance

### Overview

Explorations of slowness over the last generation have ranged from the
‘slow food’ movement, ‘slow scholarship’ and ‘slow technology’ in
design practice (Hallnäs and Redström 2001), to recent academic work
on aesthetic slowness (Koepnick 2014) and in popular culture, the
emergence of ‘slow television’ (BBC Four Goes Slow,
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02q34z8]). Whilst speed has been an
ubiquitous trope surrounding cultures of the technological, in this
workshop we focus on the implications of different notions and
approaches to slowness in relation to the body (hearing, seeing,
performing), sound and composition (composition of code, music,
writing or a mixture of all three).

This workshop is open to coders/performers and writers/theorists
alike. Our objective is to allow participants to experience and
understand the aesthetic value of altering the timescale of live
coding and live performance, and to consider the wider social and
theoretical meanings of doing so. We consider this workshop to be an
experimental laboratory rather than a masterclass.

What to expect: firstly, through simple workshop situations, we will
facilitate participants to experience the ‘texture of the present’ via
a series of slow activities aimed at the senses. Secondly, through
participants’ own work, we will provide a framework for participants
to consider and experiment with how insights gained from the above
might open up potentials for their own practice of composition (and
therefore for the experience of their audience or readership). There
will be an opportunity for an open group discussion of issues and
discoveries that have arisen at the end of the session.

Some of the questions that have informed the content of our workshops
are:

* How does timescale adjust the meaning and experience of a work? Can we
meaningfully distinguish between aesthetic and purely temporal
slowness?
* How can slowness be used as a non-oppositional force of the contemporary?
* ‘To slow code, is to know code’? (Hall 2007)
* What might a mindful experience of the electronic feel like?
* To what extent does subjectivity–authorship control code and under what circumstances does it collaborate with code to let in creative ‘unknowns’?

We ask participants to bring a current piece of work in process with
them to the workshop (and a laptop if a coder, an instrument if a
musician and writing means if a writer).

### Workshop leaders

Hester Reeve has been working with time based live art performance for
over 20 years. Many of her solo works are over 4 hours long, sometimes
spread over a period of days. In 2012 Reeve devised the AHRC-funded
“Live Notation – Extending Matters of Performance” with live coder
Alex McLean ([http://blog.livenotation.org]).

Composer, performer and musicologist Tom Hall coined the music-related
meaning of the term ‘slow code’ in a 2007 manifesto (Hall, 2007) and
has a decade’s worth of experience teaching and performing using
SuperCollider. Recent compositional work uses traditional instruments
with electronics whilst embracing notions of aesthetic slowness.
