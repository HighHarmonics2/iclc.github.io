## Opusmodus: Live Coding and Music Composition Environment Workshop

* Stephane Boussuge, Composer, Sound-designer, Associate Composer at
  Opusmodus Ltd.

  "Composing music today is a fascinating business. As the technology
  gets more complex, I feel more like a computer programmer than a
  musician. But I take the sounds in my head and in the world around
  me and bend the technology into the world I want to create." -
  Robert Rich

Algorithmic software is revolutionizing creative disciplines. 3D
design, film animation and CGI effects, textiles, ceramics, fine art
practice… We are now also seeing extraordinary inventions in signature
buildings that have been designed by applying parametric software
(Rhino and Grasshopper).

### Why Opusmodus?

Opusmodus software operates by the same principles. Opusmodus is a new
Live Coding and Music Composition environment with hundreds of
functions generating and processing musical events combined with
features enabling also an output in the form of a score notation.

With design factor points to realize and render thoughts and ideas in
standard staff notation, Opusmodus is particularly appropriate for
creating music for human performance combining instruments and
voices. Let’s not assume that it cannot be useful in other areas of
music, but we have realized that there is a gap in the production of
concert and media music (including games) that Opusmodus can fill
effectively.

At the heart of Opusmodus is OMN (Opus Modus Notation), a special
notation describing every possible score notation output as a
script. The multiple functions in Opusmodus can generate and
manipulate OMN notation, for Live Coding or Music Score composition,
giving a very elegant, powerful and innovative way to compose music.

This workshop will introduce you to the Opusmodus Environment and
teach the basics of this powerful music creation software.

### What are you going to get from this workshop?

1. New possibility for music composition exploration and experimentation
2. New toolbox understanding with hundreds of tools
3. Access to the Opusmodus user’s community
4. Good knowledge of score generation and creation with Opusmodus tools
5. Global view of all the software features:
5.1 Fast score generation
5.2 Export to MusicXml
5.3 Midi import capabilities
5.4 Powerful music description language


### What are the requirements?

A computer, a desire to learn, a willingness to share your passion for
music composition with your peers around a truly innovative
composition tool designed to leverage your creativity!  


### Opusmodus Workshop or how you can embrace your creativity with a powerful user centric tool designed by composers for composers!



**The workshop will start with the presentation of the Opusmodus
  environment…**

How the composer will use the Opusmodus interface with its many
features will always be related to her/his experience and personal
choice. But one of the objectives around the design of Opusmodus is to
respond to the various approaches composers have to make in particular
projects under certain circumstances.

No creative task is ever quite the same, so it would be foolish to
expect one workspace design to ‘catch all’ desires. Nevertheless, the
Opusmodus interface is multi-faceted and has already proved it can
deal with very exacting musical situations from the highly conceptual
and experimental to the pragmatic needs of a commissioned work.

**… followed by a presentation of Opus Modus Notation key features,**

As music notation moves inextricably from printed pages to backlit
digital displays, OMN language fully responds to the future of music
presentation. With computers replacing pianos as a composer’s
helpmate, so have the conditions changed surrounding music creation.

New music technology has focused largely on production and
presentation, whereas the conceptualisation and origination of new
music requires a very different paradigm. Opusmodus takes a step
towards that paradigm, being a 3rd way forward and driven by its own
notation script OMN.

Working directly in OMN is perfect for those ‘on the fly’ experiments
(test and learn!) that all composers make when they are starting out
on a project.

It is almost like having a piano close by to lay down new creative
thoughts, but with one that always plays what’s written quite
flawlessly and captures your creativity at a particular time,
anywhere, everywhere.


**… with a review of some typical approach to music composition using
  Opusmodus toolbox key features** (System Functions)

With such a powerful application, there are just so many things that
are not just useful but necessary. You need to dive into it. But the
advantage of a digital workspace for a composer is that it can bring
together in a single location many, different, and essential things we
need to make ever lasting music creation. We will this opportunity to
study some of the System Functions that form the vocabulary of the
scripting language of Opusmodus… in just a few hours!

**… and finally improvise together with Opusmodus showing the features of the “Live Coding Instrument” (LCI):**

The LCI gives the composer an intuitive control panel and the
possibility of working in true live coding style directly with the
script. In practice composers who use the Live Coding Instrument often
begin with a script, making a change, then ‘playing’ that change from
the buttons of the LCI control panel. Where it becomes a true
composer’s instrument is in its “Save” button. Yes the “save
button”. This function captures to midi-file every nuance of a ‘live’
session . . . and from midi-file, via the Export menu, to OMN script
and from there, well let’s say there is no frontier between technology
and creativity.
