## Live Coding the OpenGL Fragment Shader with Audio Responsiveness

* Shawn Lawson, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

### Purpose

The intent of this workshop is to create a larger community of graphics-based live coders and introduce a performance IDE, _The Force_. _The Force_ is open source, [https://github.com/shawnlawson/The_Force](https://github.com/shawnlawson/The_Force) ; run it here, [http://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/](http://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/). 

### Curriculum

All portions are hands-on, total length is approximately 3
hours. Additional detailed material can easily be included should 4
hours be expected. For self-starters, the IDE has Open Sound Control
communication, should anyone which to connect to external
applications.

* 15 min - Introductions and getting everyone up and running 
* 10 min - Explanation of the tool, how it's constructed, and how it works: lecture/demonstration 
* 25 min - Some basic functionalities of the OpenGL Fragment Shader: color, texture, uniforms, coordinate spaces 
* 10 min - Break/breather 
* 50 min - Some simple coding examples: basic math, shapes, lines, patterns, animation 
* 10 min - Break/breather 
* 60 min - Integrate audio source with some examples, go live coding crazy: audio input, OSC for the adventurous
