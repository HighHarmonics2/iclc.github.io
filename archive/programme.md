During the day, the conference took place at the School of Music,
University of Leeds. By night, we enjoyed the Left Bank venue on
Monday, and Wharf Chambers on Wednesday. Tuesday night was for
'relaxing'.

There was also a
[warm-up party in Sheffield](https://www.facebook.com/events/1421854724792689/)
on the 11th July.
