## Live Coding with Utopia

* Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research

This workshop will introduce participants to networked live coding in
SuperCollider using the Utopia library
([https://github.com/muellmusik/Utopia]). Utopia is a modular library
for the creation of networked music applications, and builds upon the
work of the Republic Quark and other older network systems in
SuperCollider. It aims to be modular (features available largely 'Ã  la
carte'), secure (provides methods for authentication and encryption),
and flexible (to the extent possible, it tries not to impose a
particular design or architecture). It provides functionality for
synchronisation, communication, code sharing, and data sharing.

For the last two years, the Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic
Research has used Utopia as the primary platform for its activities,
and actively developed it in workshops, rehearsals, and concerts. In
these sessions, members of BEER will introduce participants to the
library and its possibilities for live coding, with a particular
emphasis on creating networked structures for live coded
improvisation.
