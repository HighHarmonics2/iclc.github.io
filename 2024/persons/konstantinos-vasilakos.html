			`<p>Konstantinos Vasilakos originally from Athens, Greece, was born in 1980. With a Master’s degree and Ph.D. in music technology, his academic journey has been marked by a profound dedication to exploring the intersection of technology and art. Over the course of a decade, he has cultivated expertise in live electroacoustic and computer music improvisation. Konstantinos’s innovative research focuses on human-machine interaction and the optimization of generative systems for live electronic music composition. His work has pushed the boundaries of interactive sound, resulting in captivating projects like ”Dark Matter” and the ”Interactive Physics Sonification System” (IPSOS), which bridge the worlds of science and art. As a lecturer, Konstantinos imparts his extensive knowledge to students, offering courses that cover a spectrum of sound-art-related disciplines. His academic record and publications in prestigious conferences, such as NIME, ICMC, ICLC, and ISMIR, and journals such as Computer Music Journal, underscore his expertise, making him a valued asset of Xi’an Jiaotong – Liverpool University, School of Cultural Technology, in China.</p>`);
