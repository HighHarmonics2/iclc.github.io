Definitions of live coding provided by some of the ICLC registrants:

* Writing code where the feedback cycle of instructions is close to real-time
* live coding is creating changeable art with changeable text instructions
* Editing textual code with immediate results.
* a contested set of practices that explore the computer as a (sonic) time machine with emergent properties 
* Editing a running program such that the edits take a potentially immediate effect
* Writing (visible) code during the performance, this may be inside a framework or consist of prepared snippets,  but it can be changed on the fly to improvise
a form of self expression aided by real-time feedback from programming environments
* Making software as a performance
* Coming from a musical standpoint; The use of programming via text/language to create, modify and articulate ideas/processes as a performative gesture.
* writing and manipulating code as the (primary) interface for live performance or rehearsal.
* redefinable
* Sculpting realtime algorithms
* Improvised performance which includes the writing and/or editing of a generative rule set.
* Acts of expression and communication that involve the creation, modification and display of codes.
* live coding = virtual being
* the performance of programming
* A technique used to make the computer do a process in real time
* Dynamic interaction between the coder(s) and the machine.
* Use of a programming language to generate music or visuals in a live performance context
* the real time scripting game
* For me live coding is the joy of collective experience of digital music, in the middle of a more "lonely listening" experience of music proposed by most of digital devices.  
* Live coding is write and/or modify algorithmic procedures on-the-fly, bound for creating any kind of process-event; it comes to an intellectual and sensible exchange, a celebration of risk and change, a conversation that provides access to thought.
* The planned flow of the unexpected
* Write code in front of people.
* Live creation and manipulation of sound (or other)-producing graphs.
* on the fly events generation by code scripting
* to modify a computer program while it is running.
* writing code in front of an audience who can see the relationship between changes to the code and changes in some form output, usually music or live visuals. 
* A musical instrument like any other, with its own peculiarities and way of playing.
* the interactive control of algorithmic processes through programming activity
* Creative expression mediated through a coding language in front of an audience
* Live coding is for me a way to explore, on a very much hands-on way, the creative potential from computers, humans and algorithms combined. It is a door to a sort of third space where the rules can be redefined.
* A Cybernetic human-machine system (the HC interface is a conceptual/physical boundary between component parts of the system)
* feeding symbols with meanings into interpreting (machine) systems in real-time for translation into music/visual performance signs
* a real-time action, including instructions 
* coding (music/sound) in real time, while listening assessing and feeding back appropriate code.
* A broad description of live performance of computer music or analog music using computer.
* Writing the code that produces the performance during the performance itself.  The code may start from 0 (nothing, scratch), or there may be pre-written parts to be executed.  But always there is the choice of what to execute at a given moment, and the code is at least modified during the performance. 
* live algorithmic performance
* LiveCoding: (Mexican def.) The action of programming making it creative by drinking some mezcal.
* Live Coding is the use of knowledge for the realization of a sound or visual idea through the computer.
* Real time electronic music structuring
* Live Coding = Virtual Being
* An interactive programming often used to create digital media such as music with improvisation.
* Can I come back and edit this answer later? (Note, this is my definition, not a question. Well, actually both.)
* Writing code during sound/image/text performance and as a contributory and necessary part of it
* A very open form of engaging with interpreters through code - resistant to definitions - playful -  fun - never to be defined.
* Using code as a form of expression.
* algorithmic composition created on the spot
* while true { edit(); experience(); enjoy(); }
* conscious choices of determinism and indeterminism in a live performance
* "Live Coding is about (live) process in general, reveals the process of production and uses production as a performance element. As a visual artist/performer I am more interested in the (open) process of art/performance/music production rather than the (closed) final product. In the context of Open Source I share the belief that processes of production should not be hidden.
* Live Coding with or without computer programming/source code often draws on rhythmic patterns and audio/sound/movement elements edited through improvisation and intuition. "
* IT'S COOL.
* life coding
* Responding to an environment
* Computer-mediated interaction with multi-sensory performance.
* Programming as performance.
* fluid development at the speed of thought
* Writing code without the requirement to lip-sync.
* A feedback loop involving the insertion of code into a running process, which then changes, and causes new responses, which in turn stimulates the insertion of further code and so on.
* Pre-arranged coding on the spot during a performance
* as something that will always outstrip my attempts to define it
* thinking while diving
* Personal toll and understanding with God
* Hearing and seeing on projectors or tv shows live the words and instructions from God through pastor Chris our papa
* The use of programming languages to compose and perform music, usually to an audience that can view the information on the screen
* Run time is all the time.
* Spontaneous and synergistic generation of digital control structures
* The act and process of producing creative sounds or visuals by programming.
* not live codding
