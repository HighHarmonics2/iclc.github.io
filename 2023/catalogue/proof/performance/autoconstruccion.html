        <h4>Program Notes</h4>
        <p>[<strong>NEEDS UPDATE</strong> - this was the Artist Statement, as no Program Note was given. (Proposal Template was not followed)] Starting from the universe of code possibilities, creative programmers Malitzin Cortes (aka CNDSD) and Iván
Abreu direct their different creative explorations from architecture and sound art, algorithmic music to the
intersections between science and art. Together they generate a conversation full of digital poetics that is lived
in experiences in constant mutation defined as live cinema coding and immersive experiences.</p>
        <h4>Abstract</h4><p><em><br>The abstract is displayed here for proof-reading and will only be part of the published proceedings, not of the final version of this web catalogue.</em></p><p>AUTO{}Construcción is an audiovisual concert of live coding and algorithm-based video game experience that 
explores the relationship between speculative architecture and the phenomena of informal housing executed 
by "non-architects" in countries such as Mexico, the United States, Latin America, Asia, India and some 
European peripheries, collaboratively creating 3D imaginaries with machine learning. The audiovisual 
immersion is guided by text and also by an avatar.</p>
<p>This research on live coding through scenic hybridizations close to live cinema, immersive experiences and 
video games began with the support of the "on the fly" ZKM residency. Technically, the system has evolved
allowing to imagine and create scenarios and narratives from the keyboard and the body. </p>
<p>The work also reflects on the challenges that were proposed to the collective imagination of "the cyberpunk 
megalopolises of the future" in the 60s, 70s and 80s and the great changes in those paradigms. Did the time 
machine visit any of humanity's many possible multiverses? Or is it just that the future has changed and so 
has the speculation of its urban environment that seems closer to the stark and changing social and economic 
phenomena throughout our world? In our present, habitability is deciphered from the urgency of occupation, 
desire, imitation and counterproposal through new formal languages of the "informal style" generated from 
years and years of self-construction, self-taught, autonomous design and collective learning.</p>
<p>This research and ongoing work wants to find these "new styles" generated from years and years of 
self-construction, autonomous and collective learning that have generated great knowledge; It also seeks to 
hybridize these styles in their similarities and differences from a "digital miscegenation" now possible 
with the collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence.</p>
