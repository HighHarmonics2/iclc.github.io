        <p>On top of all of the chaos that goes into organizing a show, the logistics involved in
documenting can feel like an expendable effort. However, time and time again I thank
myself and my co-organizers for investing the energy in documenting.</p>
<p>Having good documentation means the performers have quality assets for their portfolios.
It means we have promotion assets for the next shows. It means we can apply for grants for
future shows. It means we can tell the story for future audiences.</p>
<p>Documentation is a life-long practice. It can breathe new life into the work. When it is
treated like a craft more than an afterthought, so much can be possible.</p>
<p>The workshop is a theoretical and practical session on the craft of documenting art,
specifically through the lens of live-code performances.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4><p><em><br>The abstract is displayed here for proof-reading and will only be part of the published proceedings, not of the final version of this web catalogue.</em></p><p>Documentation is a life-long practice. It can breathe new life into the work. When it is
treated like a craft more than an afterthought, so much can be possible.</p>
<p>Since ICLC 2020, I have had the opportunity to perform and organize many (exactly 42!)
live-code shows online, in Brooklyn, San Francisco and Berlin. When working with each
venue, the question is always: how can we make sure we record video, line audio, and
(maybe most importantly) the screens?</p>

<p>The workshop is a theoretical and practical session on the craft of documenting art,
specifically through the lens of live-code performances.</p>
<p><strong>A high-level view of the workshop:</strong></p>
<p>Theory (30 minutes): The craft of documentation</p>
<ul>
<li>Learnings from three years of performing in and organizing shows in the world of
live-code.</li>
<li>Documentation is a life-long practice of an artist, for all different mediums</li>
<li>Case-studies: How recording performances has “paid off” later on, in ways I did not
expect.</li>
<li>A quote from someone that has stuck with me: “If the performance is not
documented, it is almost as if it never happened.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Practical (90 minutes): Let’s all create a two-minute performance!</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn to use tools to capture and ultimately the story for a performance or work.
Tools include OBS, audio routing tools, combining streams from multiple machines,
video editing tips and tricks</li>
<li>Learned practices for capturing all of the different elements of live performances</li>
<li>Different ways to format and think about presenting code so it can easily be read
(and later represented)</li>
</ul>
