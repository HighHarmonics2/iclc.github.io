        <h4>Program Notes</h4>
        <p>‘Blocking Behaviours’ concerns the real-time interpretation of two simulations of complex
behaviour through an agent-based system. The simulations enforce a way of thinking that revolves
around balancing behaviours, an attitude that considers musical output as something that emerges
from an interaction with an autonomous system. The simulation acts as a generative, rule-based
system producing output that is subject to different kinds of observation algorithms. The idea is that
evolving processes are set in motion where the creator/composer becomes an observer of various
developments. The output can not always be controlled in detail but is instead interpreted and
further processed. The interpretation involves a mapping between different modes of
representations in order to simplify or combine. In ‘Blocking Behaviours’ the idea is to explore the
boundary of generative behaviour, control and and direct access to computer sound synthesis.</p>
        <h4>Abstract</h4><p><em><br>The abstract is displayed here for proof-reading and will only be part of the published proceedings, not of the final version of this web catalogue.</em></p><p>Concieved as an experiment for mapping agent-based interaction to sound synthesis ‘Blocking
Behaviours’ is a software, piece and performance created using SuperCollider and the Terra.js
Javascript library. Using Terra.js allows for setting up local interactions with the goal of “creating
and analyzing biological simulations.” (<a href="https://rileyjshaw.com/terra">https://rileyjshaw.com/terra</a>). Terra.js runs in a web browser
where the visual outcomes of the simulations are displayed. ‘Blocking Behaviours’ reconsiders the
relationship between generative activities using the Terra.js simulations that are ‘interpreted’ by
sound processes in SuperCollider that in turn shape the simulation, creating a feedback network.</p>
<p>Running the simulations becomes the carrier of the musical development. The simulations enforce a
way of thinking that revolves around balancing behaviours, an attitude that considers musical
output as something that emerges from an interaction with an autonomous system. The simulation
acts as a generative, rule-based system producing output that is subject to different kinds of
observation algorithms. The idea is that evolving processes are set in motion where the
creator/composer becomes an observer of various developments. The output can not always be
controlled in detail but is instead interpreted and further processed.</p>
<p>Observation as a mode of composition is what drives many of the possible applications of ‘Blocking
Behaviours’. The observer (live-coder) attaches sound-producing algorithms to the simulations that
take place so that the resulting music becomes an interpretation of their development. Interaction
emerges through the observation of a rule-based system by attaching operations instead of
controlling interactions.</p>
<p>Besides attaching and detaching different interpretation processes, two other important modes of
control are supported: configuring the context (initial states) and interfering (or blocking) the
generated behaviours. For all three of the interaction modes both manual commands can be used as
well as audio-driven operations. This way of working introduces an operational space within which
highly detailed synthesis instructions algorithms interact and clash with blind generators of
computational behaviours such as the biological simulations. The relationship of influence goes in
both directions and across different time-scales.</p>
<p>‘Blocking Behaviour’ questions the concepts of generative activity, control, sound-synthesis through
an ongoing reconfiguration and live-coding.</p>
