        <h4>Program Notes</h4>
        <p>From emailing to e-sports, the digital world is continuing to encroach on our own. Even
those in the arts are now wondering, will I too be replaced? Can we harmonize with this
evolution rather than fight it? Saaz, a mechanically operated folk instrument, is a step
towards harmonization.</p>
<p>The instrument played by Saaz is a Chitrali sitar, a stringed instrument whose disputed
origins involve Alexander the Great and Sufi poets. This byproduct of Asia and Europe’s
intersection has been transformed by Saaz into an intersection of tradition and modernity,
demonstrating the educational and outreach capabilities of a mechanically operated
instrument. As it requires live coding to play, Saaz allows individuals to perform on
traditional folk instruments without prior training in them. If technology has become the
unifying factor between cultures, Saaz only increases accessibility to regions like Chitral,
strengthening our awareness of underrepresented cultures.</p>
        <h4>Abstract</h4><p><em><br>The abstract is displayed here for proof-reading and will only be part of the published proceedings, not of the final version of this web catalogue.</em></p><p>From emailing to e-sports, the digital world is continuing to encroach on our own. Even
those in the arts are now wondering, will I too be replaced? Can we harmonize with this
evolution rather than fight it? Saaz, a mechanically operated folk instrument, is a step
towards harmonization.</p>
<p>The instrument played by Saaz is a Chitrali sitar, a stringed instrument whose disputed
origins involve Alexander the Great and Sufi poets. This byproduct of Asia and Europe’s
intersection has been transformed by Saaz into an intersection of tradition and modernity,
demonstrating the educational and outreach capabilities of a mechanically operated
instrument.</p>
<p>Offering a new method of performance, Saaz | ساز is a prototype for decentralization,
changing ‘access to an instrument’ into ‘access to a computer’. The Chitrali sitar is
traditionally shared by households and Saaz honors that tradition by increasing our global
accessibility. As connectivity highlights our xenophobia, having a tool that allows
individuals to improve their awareness of underrepresented cultures through music will
deepen our appreciation of them and aid in their preservation.</p>
<p>The performance begins with Jahanzeb Safdar live coding instructions to Saaz via the MIDI
protocol on his laptop. As Saaz’s composition builds up, audio-reactive visuals generated by
its sound, and a live feed from the CCTV camera displaying Saaz’s mechanism in action, will
be projected across screens behind it. Irfan Ali Taj will gradually weave vocals sung in
Khowar, an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the descendents of Alexander the Great’s
conquest, as well as instrumentation from his rubab, a lute-like instrument found in
Pakistan and Afghanistan. The synchronization of audio-visual art, mechanically played
compositions and Irfan’s folk performance will swell before each component gradually
fades away, beginning with Irfan and ending with Saaz.</p>
