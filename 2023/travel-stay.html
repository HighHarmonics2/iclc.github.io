		Utrecht is well connected by train to all of the major cities and airports in the Netherlands like Schiphol Airport (30min), Eindhoven Airport (1h30), Amsterdam (30min), Rotterdam (40min) and The Hague (40min).
		<br><br>
		We recommend using the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en">Dutch Railway App (NS)</a> or the <a href="https://9292.nl/en">9292 App</a> to plan any travel with public transport within the Netherlands.
		<br><br>
		From Utrecht it is also possible to take the international trains such as the ICE train towards Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria`, `assets/img/utrecht-station.jpg`);

		It is also possible to get around by bus, tram or train between the locations. We recommend using the <a href="https://9292.nl/">9292 App</a> to plan any travel with public transport with Utrecht.
