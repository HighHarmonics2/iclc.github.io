        <h1 class="mb-4">Open Call for the ICLC 2023 in Utrecht</h1>
        <p>The International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) is dedicated to practices and research focused on technologies and philosophies that interpret the use of computer code as gesture within the context of live performances. In its previous editions the community has offered important insights on this practice from many diverse perspectives &ndash; technical, philosophical, educational, political and more.</p>
        <p>ICLC 2023 takes place in Utrecht, The Netherlands from April 19 to April 23 2023, and we wish to challenge our community to bridge even further to its multidisciplinary strengths. We are pleased to invite submissions of proposed contributions in the form of theoretical works, live and live-recorded audio/visual performances, videos, workshops and satellite events. This call is open to everyone. We encourage submissions that cover <strong>any topic related to live coding</strong>, but in particular we invite the exploration of the following overarching main theme:</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-5">Displacement</h2>
        <p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement">Wikipedia</a>: <strong><em>Displacement (linguistics)</em></strong>, the ability of humans (and possibly some animals) to communicate ideas that are remote in time and/or space. <strong><em>Forced displacement</em></strong>, by persecution or violence. <strong><em>Displacement (psychology)</em></strong>, a sub-conscious defense mechanism.)</p>
        <p>The last few years, and probably also the years that will follow, show us how easily physical spaces we once considered safe and secure can become increasingly hostile environments due to new strains of pathogens, climate change or aggression. At the same time, we are confronted with new technologies for automated creation that might drastically change the value of the digital artisan's craft.</p>
        <p>We invite you to reflect on the roles and opportunities that live coding practices, techniques and communities can play in these times of displacement - but equally to be inspired by other uses of the term, e.g. rhythmic displacement in music, displacement shaders, displacement in terms of physics, linguistics or psychology or generally being out-of-place, in many places at the same time or in representation instead of in situ.</p>

        <p class="mt-5">More concretely, we are particularily looking for submissions relating to any of the following topics:</p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">(Trans|Inter)disciplinary Live Coding</h3>
        <p>Live Coding is represented by communities with a strong focus on making audio and music. The writing of code as a performative act is however also practiced in other maker cultures and disciplines such as graphic design, visuals, games (shaders/demoscene), education, theatre and dance. As such the practice of live coding is displaced to other disciplines making it more inter- and transdisciplinary in character. We encourage submissions reflecting on how approaches and ideologies to live coding differ or overlap between these cultures, as well as on how they influence other disciplines and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Human/Machine Entanglement</h3>
        <p>The live coding practice is now 20 years old, having grown up alongside the processes that transformed AI and machine learning research in the mid-90s. Today we are looking at the diverse algorithmic agencies of the learning systems used in live coding context. The live coding feedback loop entangles mind, body and machines within physical interactions, through both machine-body and machine-mind relationships. We encourage submissions reflecting on those intersections, embracing questions such as live vs. offline training, dataset bias and size, algorithmic agencies and human-machine entanglements. Moreover, we look for submissions analysing displacement or re-placement of creativity.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Community Reports</h3>
        <p>We believe that one of the strong pillars of live coding is the community, both digitally and locally. It is the effort of people working together that helps to shape the live coding practice, facilitate spaces, define its tendencies and aesthetics and influence its outreach. In past years we have seen the communities around live coding expand, diversify, and professionalize while building bonds with each other to make a global community. The conference will open a space for 'Community Reports' &ndash; a short presentation introducing your local community and activities. Share with us the characteristics that define your community, its history, your ways of organizing and working together, your difficulties and your successes.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Who we are</h2>
        <p>The 2023 ICLC edition is organized by four live coding communities and artistic institutions based in the Netherlands, Ljubljana, Barcelona and Karlsruhe. This partnership emerged from the <a href="https://onthefly.space">on-the-fly</a> project carried out by a spread network across those places. Therefore, this ICLC edition is produced with a commitment to distributed work, where the organization process occurs as a feedback loop between communities.</p>

        <p><strong>Location: Utrecht, The Netherlands</strong></p>
        <p>Live coding performances during ICLC 2023 will take place at a diverse selection of venues both in and around Utrecht.</p>

        <hr class="mt-5"/>
        <h2 class="text-uppercase mb-4">Code of Conduct</h2>

        <p>All participants are expected to read and adhere to the <a href="code-of-conduct.html">ICLC 2023 official Code of Conduct</a>, not only at the Conference but in all related proceedings and interactions with the ICLC community, online or in person.</p>

        <h4>Environmental Statement</h4>
        <p>We invite everyone to reflect on the impact that our research and practice has on our environment and ecosystems. Acknowledging this, we are incorporating sustainability and conservation criteria as guidelines for the conference planning. We invite everyone to take this into consideration before and after the conference. In the spirit of coming together for a live event, we want to encourage in-person attendance, and also encourage that attendees joining us make choices to minimize the impact of their travel with low-carbon options whenever possible. We also commit to fostering connections among attendees and nearby satellite events, to make the most of long distance travel with opportunities to turn your visit into a mini-tour. The presentations and performances of the conference will be live-streamed whenever possible. We are also open to hosting remote presentations when this is the best option.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-5">ICLC Satellite Events</h4>
        <ul><li>Format: Declaration of interest</li>
          <li>Submit via email to <a href="mailt:iclc-events@creativecodingutrecht.nl">iclc-events@creativecodingutrecht.nl</a> until 15 January 2023</li></ul>
        <p>We invite live coding nodes from all over the world &ndash; but in particular from Europe &ndash; to host their own satellite events prior or after ICLC 2023. The goal is to create opportunities for traveling artists to perform or do a workshop in multiple locations (or on the way from/to Utrecht) and to turn ICLC 2023 into a tour &ndash; with Utrecht at its peak. While the committee of the ICLC cannot directly help with funding or organisation of your event an effort will be made to coordinate dates, locations and potential artists.</p>

        <p>Please submit your intent to participate with your own event, providing us with a principal contact to your group/organization, the city where the event will take place and any information that might already be definitive (set date, set venue, line-up...).</p>
          
        <p>We ask you to investigate possibilities to apply for local funding to help cover for accomodations, travel costs and in the best case artist fees. We can provide you with a letter of intent to support applications for funding, and will publish the date and url of your event on the ICLC website.</p>
