Registration will open on the 10th April 2015, and will be £60 (£50 concessions) for the full three days of the conference, including lunch, tshirt, stickers and USB key.

For those who have financial difficulties in attending, there will volunteering opportunities, and we also have a small travel bursary to apply to.
