Registration will open during March 2015. We are still calculating
costs but expect that registration will be in the region of Â£60 for
the full three days of the conference, including lunch.

There will be concessionary rates and volunteering opportunities, and
we may be able to provide financial assistance to those who would
otherwise be unable to attend.
