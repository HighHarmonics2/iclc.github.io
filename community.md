Online resources for the live coding community:

## Live coding research network

The [Live Coding Research Network](http://livecodenetwork.org/) is
funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council from Feb 2014 until
Feb 2016, and this is one of a series of events we're organising
during this time.

## TOPLAP blog

TOPLAP is a community of live coding researchers, practitioners and
the otherwise interested. Follow their [blog](http://toplap.org/) for
the latest live coding news.

## Fora

The TOPLAP [livecode forum](http://lurk.org/groups/livecode/) is the
main place for online live coding discussion, which can be accessed
both as a web forum and via email. There's also an [algorave
forum](http://lurk.org/groups/algorave) on the same server.

## Social media

Keep up to date by following the live coding research network [on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/livecodenet) or liking us [on

There's also a [facebook
event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1559892980919545/) for the
