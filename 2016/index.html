<h2>Second International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC 2016)</h2>

<p><strong>12-15th October 2016, McMaster University, Canada</strong><br />
<a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/">http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/</a>
</p>
<p>
On behalf of the organizing committee, the steering committee and the Live Coding Research Network, we are pleased to invite abstracts for proposed contributions to the International Conference on Live Coding 2016 (ICLC 2016), which will take place at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from October 12th to October 15th, 2016. ICLC 2016 follows the <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2015/">inaugural International Conference on Live Coding</a> held last year at the University of Leeds, UK.
</p>
<p>
Live coding is making changes to algorithms as they run, with the possibility for both live feedback and a live audience. A growing movement has explored live coding to create music and visuals in performance settings, while software engineering has investigated new directions in live programming language design. Researchers in many other disciplines (education, dance, psychology, ethnography and others) have begun to examine live coding’s potential to generate new research questions, methods and solutions. For more information on live coding, please refer to the <a href="http://toplap.org">TOPLAP website</a>, and to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/collection/user-iclc2015">proceedings</a> and <a href="http://is.gd/iclcvid">video archive</a> of <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2015/">ICLC 2015</a>.
</p>
<p>
Live coding performances during ICLC 2016 will take place at a diverse selection of venues both on the McMaster University campus and in downtown Hamilton. Some performance sessions will take place in McMaster’s LIVELab, a research centre and performance space that includes an active acoustics system, a large multi-channel speaker array addressed via network audio, a video wall and a Disklavier piano. The conference has been timed to coincide with Hamilton’s monthly art crawl and will involve collaboration with a number of local arts organizations. The final event of the conference will be an algorave at Hamilton’s Spice Factory.
</p>
<p>
ICLC 2016 will be a single-stream conference, with sessions organized into three broad thematic groups: (1) “Collaboration and Networks” will encompass the intersection of live coding with computer networking and, more broadly, with technologies and practices of collaboration; (2) “Interpretations” examines the history, semiotics and hermeneutics of live coding, with a sensitivity to diverse perspectives and multiple points of origin; (3) “Applications” unfolds the fullest possible range of application of live coding (including but not limited to the live coding of graphics, motion, and design). All submissions proposing an original contribution to Live Coding research and practice will be welcomed, including submissions that challenge these conference themes. All submissions are expected to cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research methods.
</p>
<p>
All accepted contributions will be cited in an application for support from Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), which, if granted, may make available limited funding to support delegates’ travel expenses. The proceedings of the conference will be published with an ISBN, and a per-paper DOI, and there will be an opportunity to contribute to the inaugural issue of a new, open-access, peer-reviewed journal, Networked Imagination.
</p>

<li>4th April 2016* - deadline for submissions</li>
<li>29th April 2016 - notification of acceptance</li>
<li>30th June 2016 - camera-ready deadline for proceedings</li>
<li>12-15th October 2016 - conference</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contribution types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Short Papers / Extended Abstracts (2-4 pages in proceedings)</li>
<li>Long Papers (5-12 pages in proceedings)</li>
<li>Posters and Demonstrations (2-4 pages in proceedings)</li>
<li>Performances (video documentation published following conference)</li>
<li>Workshops (700-word abstract in proceedings)</li>
</ul>

<p>To propose a short paper, extended abstract (2-4 pages) or long paper (5-12 pages) for the conference, please submit a complete draft of the paper/abstract, a condensed outline (100-150 words) and a short biography (100-150 words) through the <a href="http://iclc2016.mcmaster.ca">online peer review system</a>.
</p>
<p>

To propose a poster or demonstration for the conference, please submit a complete draft of an accompanying short paper (2-4 pages), a condensed outline (100-150 words) and a short biography (100-150 words) through the <a href="http://iclc2016.mcmaster.ca">online peer review system</a>.
</p>
<p>

To propose a live coding performance for the conference, please submit a detailed abstract (700 words), a stable link to a single video example, a brief outline/programme note (100-150 words) and a short biography (100-150 words) through the <a href="http://iclc2016.mcmaster.ca">online peer review system</a>. We encourage both risk-taking proposals which push forward the state of the art, and refined presentations of highly-developed practice. In either case, please support your submission with a clear description of your performance, and discussion of influences and prior art as appropriate. Please provide complete answers to the technical questions asked by the online peer review system during your submission.
</p>
<p>
Please email feedback and/or questions to conference chair <a href="mailto:ogbornd@mcmaster.ca">David Ogborn</a>.
