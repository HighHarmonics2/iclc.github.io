<h2>International Conference on Live Coding 2016 (ICLC 2016)</h2>

<p>
Live coding is making changes to algorithms as they run, with the possibility for both live feedback and a live audience. A growing movement has explored live coding to create music and visuals in performance settings, while software engineering has investigated new directions in live programming language design. Researchers in many other disciplines (education, dance, psychology, ethnography and others) have begun to examine live coding’s potential to generate new research questions, methods and solutions. For more information on live coding, please refer to the <a href="http://toplap.org/">TOPLAP website</a>, and to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/collection/user-iclc2015">proceedings</a> and <a href="http://is.gd/iclcvid">video archive</a> of <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/2015/">ICLC 2015</a>.
</p>

<p>The International Conference on Live Coding 2016 (ICLC 2016) is being hosted by McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (see <a href="travel.html">"Travel"</a>), with support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Faculty of Humanities at McMaster, as well as many other individuals and organizations (see <a href="team.html">"Team"</a>). Live coding performances during ICLC 2016 will take place at a diverse selection of venues both on the McMaster University campus and in downtown Hamilton. Some performance sessions will take place in McMaster’s LIVELab, a research centre and performance space that includes an active acoustics system, a large multi-channel speaker array addressed via network audio, a video wall and a Disklavier piano. The conference has been timed to coincide with Hamilton’s monthly art crawl and will involve collaboration with a number of local arts organizations. The final event of the conference will be an algorave at Hamilton’s Spice Factory. The full conference schedule and links to free tickets for both the conference and/or the closing algorave (subject to availability) can be found <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.

<p>Please email feedback and/or questions to conference chair <a href="mailto:ogbornd@mcmaster.ca">David Ogborn</a>.</p>
