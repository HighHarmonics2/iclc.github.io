<p>
Live coding is making changes to algorithms as they run, with the possibility for both live feedback and a live audience. A growing movement has explored live coding to create music and visuals in performance settings, while software engineering has investigated new directions in live programming language design. Researchers in many other disciplines (education, dance, psychology, ethnography and others) have begun to examine live codingâ€™s potential to generate new research questions, methods and solutions. For more information on live coding, please refer to the <a href="http://toplap.org/">TOPLAP website</a>, and to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/collection/user-iclc2015">proceedings</a> and <a href="http://is.gd/iclcvid">video archive</a> of <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/2015/">ICLC 2015</a>.
</p>

<p>The second International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC 2016) will take
place at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from October 12th
to October 15th, 2016. ICLC 2016 follows the inaugural International
Conference on Live Coding held last year at the University of Leeds, UK.  An
earlier call and peer review process has produced a vibrant collection of
papers and concert/algorave performance proposals reflecting both
established practices and risk-taking new and experimental directions in the
field. At this time, we are pleased to invite additional "late-breaking"
submissions to the International Conference on Live Coding 2016, in two
categories:</p>

<p>1. Posters and Demonstrations: ICLC 2016 is a single-stream conference and
so poster/demonstration sessions will be a chance for substantial, informal
interaction and discussion with all conference attendees. Posters and
demonstrations must be accompanied by a 2-4 page paper, using <a href="calls.html">the official
conference templates</a>, that will be subjected to rigorous peer review and, if
accepted, included in the conference proceedings (with an ISBN and per-paper
DOI).</p>

<p>2. Art crawl Performances: On the evening of Friday 14th October 2016, the
conference will intersect with Hamilton's monthly downtown art crawl, with
performances at a number of venues around the art crawl district.  During
the art crawl, many galleries are open simultaneously, typically with new
exhibitions, while a large general public audience freely wanders from show
to show. While this late-breaking call is open to any all performance
proposals, proposals which are particularly suited to the art crawl setting
are highly encouraged (including but not limited to performances oriented to
gallery spaces, adapted mobile and fluctuating audiences, potentially
blurring the lines between art exhibition and live coding performance, etc).</p>

<p>To make a late-breaking submission to ICLC 2016, create an account as an author with the online
peer review system at <a href="http://iclc2016.mcmaster.ca/">iclc2016.mcmaster.ca</a>, log in as an author and click on "Step One of the Submission Process" on the page labeled "Active Submissions". Choose the Late-Breaking Submissions conference track and either Poster/Demo or Performance for the submission type. Please note that the deadline of 29<super>th</super> August
2016 for late-breaking submissions will be <u>strictly</u> upheld.</p>

<p>Please email any feedback and/or questions to conference chair <a href="mailto:ogbornd@mcmaster.ca">David Ogborn</a>.</p>
