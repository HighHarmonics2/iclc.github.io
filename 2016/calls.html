<h2>Late-breaking call for posters/demos and art crawl performances at ICLC 2016</h2>

<p>Timeline:
<ul>
<li>29<super>th</super> August 2016 - deadline for late-breaking submissions</li>
<li>12<super>th</super> September 2016 - notification of acceptance</li>
<li>12-15<super>th</super> October 2016 - conference</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>(Note: For the conference' original call - now completed - see further below.)</p>

<p>
Live coding is making changes to algorithms as they run, with the possibility for both live feedback and a live audience. A growing movement has explored live coding to create music and visuals in performance settings, while software engineering has investigated new directions in live programming language design. Researchers in many other disciplines (education, dance, psychology, ethnography and others) have begun to examine live coding’s potential to generate new research questions, methods and solutions. For more information on live coding, please refer to the <a href="http://toplap.org">TOPLAP website</a>, and to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/collection/user-iclc2015">proceedings</a> and <a href="http://is.gd/iclcvid">video archive</a> of <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2015/">ICLC 2015</a>.
</p>

<p>The second International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC 2016) will take
place at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from October 12th
to October 15th, 2016. ICLC 2016 follows the inaugural International
Conference on Live Coding held last year at the University of Leeds, UK.  An
earlier call and peer review process has produced a vibrant collection of
papers and concert/algorave performance proposals reflecting both
established practices and risk-taking new and experimental directions in the
field. At this time, we are pleased to invite additional "late-breaking"
submissions to the International Conference on Live Coding 2016, in two
categories:</p>

<p>1. Posters and Demonstrations: ICLC 2016 is a single-stream conference and
so poster/demonstration sessions will be a chance for substantial, informal
interaction and discussion with all conference attendees. Posters and
demonstrations must be accompanied by a 2-4 page paper, using <a href="   ">the official
conference templates</a>, that will be subjected to rigorous peer review and, if
accepted, included in the conference proceedings (with an ISBN and per-paper
DOI).</p>

<p>2. Art crawl Performances: On the evening of Friday 14th October 2016, the
conference will intersect with Hamilton's monthly downtown art crawl, with
performances at a number of venues around the art crawl district.  During
the art crawl, many galleries are open simultaneously, typically with new
exhibitions, while a large general public audience freely wanders from show
to show. While this late-breaking call is open to any all performance
proposals, proposals which are particularly suited to the art crawl setting
are highly encouraged (including but not limited to performances oriented to
gallery spaces, adapted mobile and fluctuating audiences, potentially
blurring the lines between art exhibition and live coding performance, etc).</p>

<p>To make a late-breaking submission to ICLC 2016, create an account as an author with the online
peer review system at <a href="iclc2016.mcmaster.ca">iclc2016.mcmaster.ca</a>, log in as an author and click on "Step One of the Submission Process" on the page labeled "Active Submissions". Choose the Late-Breaking Submissions conference track and either Poster/Demo or Performance for the submission type. Please note that the deadline of 29<super>th</super> August
2016 for late-breaking submissions will be <u>strictly</u> upheld.</p>

<p>Please email any feedback and/or questions to conference chair <a href="mailto:ogbornd@mcmaster.ca">David Ogborn</a>.</p>

<h2>Original Call for Papers/Performances/</h2>

<p><strong>12-15th October 2016, McMaster University, Canada</strong><br />
<a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/">http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/</a>
</p>

<p><i>Note 1:</i> The official templates for paper/poster/demo proposals are available here: <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/templates-iclc2016.zip">http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/templates-iclc2016.zip</a></p>

<p><i>Note 2:</i> The technical questionnaire for performance and workshop proposals is available here: <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/technical-questionnaire-iclc2016.pdf">http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2016/technical-questionnaire-iclc2016.pdf</a></p>

<p>
On behalf of the organizing committee, the steering committee and the Live Coding Research Network, we are pleased to invite abstracts for proposed contributions to the International Conference on Live Coding 2016 (ICLC 2016), which will take place at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from October 12th to October 15th, 2016. ICLC 2016 follows the <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2015/">inaugural International Conference on Live Coding</a> held last year at the University of Leeds, UK.
</p>
<p>
Live coding performances during ICLC 2016 will take place at a diverse selection of venues both on the McMaster University campus and in downtown Hamilton. Some performance sessions will take place in McMaster’s LIVELab, a research centre and performance space that includes an active acoustics system, a large multi-channel speaker array addressed via network audio, a video wall and a Disklavier piano. The conference has been timed to coincide with Hamilton’s monthly art crawl and will involve collaboration with a number of local arts organizations. The final event of the conference will be an algorave at Hamilton’s Spice Factory.
</p>
<p>
ICLC 2016 will be a single-stream conference, with sessions organized into three broad thematic groups: (1) “Collaboration and Networks” will encompass the intersection of live coding with computer networking and, more broadly, with technologies and practices of collaboration; (2) “Interpretations” examines the history, semiotics and hermeneutics of live coding, with a sensitivity to diverse perspectives and multiple points of origin; (3) “Applications” unfolds the fullest possible range of application of live coding (including but not limited to the live coding of graphics, motion, and design). All submissions proposing an original contribution to Live Coding research and practice will be welcomed, including submissions that challenge these conference themes. All submissions are expected to cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research methods.
</p>
<p>
All accepted contributions will be cited in an application for support from Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), which, if granted, may make available limited funding to support delegates’ travel expenses. The proceedings of the conference will be published with an ISBN, and a per-paper DOI, and there will be an opportunity to contribute to the inaugural issue of a new, open-access, peer-reviewed journal, Networked Imagination.
