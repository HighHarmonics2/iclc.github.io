<p>
On behalf of the organizing committee, the steering committee and the Live Coding Research Network, we are pleased to invite abstracts for proposed contributions to the International Conference on Live Coding 2016 (ICLC 2016), which will take place at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from October 12th to October 15th, 2016. ICLC 2016 follows the <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/2015/">inaugural International Conference on Live Coding</a> held last year at the University of Leeds, UK.
</p>
<p>
Live coding performances during ICLC 2016 will take place at a diverse selection of venues both on the McMaster University campus and in downtown Hamilton. Some performance sessions will take place in McMaster’s LIVELab, a research centre and performance space that includes an active acoustics system, a large multi-channel speaker array addressed via network audio, a video wall and a Disklavier piano. The conference has been timed to coincide with Hamilton’s monthly art crawl and will involve collaboration with a number of local arts organizations. The final event of the conference will be an algorave at Hamilton’s Spice Factory.
</p>
<p>
ICLC 2016 will be a single-stream conference, with sessions organized into three broad thematic groups: (1) “Collaboration and Networks” will encompass the intersection of live coding with computer networking and, more broadly, with technologies and practices of collaboration; (2) “Interpretations” examines the history, semiotics and hermeneutics of live coding, with a sensitivity to diverse perspectives and multiple points of origin; (3) “Applications” unfolds the fullest possible range of application of live coding (including but not limited to the live coding of graphics, motion, and design). All submissions proposing an original contribution to Live Coding research and practice will be welcomed, including submissions that challenge these conference themes. All submissions are expected to cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research methods.
</p>
<p>
All accepted contributions will be cited in an application for support from Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), which, if granted, may make available limited funding to support delegates’ travel expenses. The proceedings of the conference will be published with an ISBN, and a per-paper DOI, and there will be an opportunity to contribute to the inaugural issue of a new, open-access, peer-reviewed journal, Networked Imagination.
