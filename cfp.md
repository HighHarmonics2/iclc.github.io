# Papers

We are accepting paper submissions for the following categories:

* Long papers (6-12 pages)
* Short papers (4-6 pages)
* Poster/demo papers (2-4 pages)
* Workshop (300 words)

All submissions must use the conference template and follow the
instructions within, available in both Microsoft Word and Markdown
formats. Download the [latest version
here](https://github.com/livecodenetwork/templates/archive/master.zip),
as a zipfile.

All submissions must be in PDF format, and submitted [via Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclc2015).

ICLC is an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches
are encouraged and we recognise that the appropriate length of a paper
may vary considerably depending on the approach. However, all
submissions must propose an original contribution to Live Coding
research, cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research
methods.

The proceedings will be published with ISBN and article DOIs, and there will also be an
follow-on opportunity to contribute to a special issue of the Journal
on Performance Arts and Digital Media; details will be announced soon.

## Themes

The following long list of topics, contributed by early career researchers in the field, are indicative of the breadth of research we wish to include:

* Live coding and the body; tangibility, gesture, embodiment
* Creative collaboration through live code
* Live coding in education, teaching and learning
* Live coding terminology and the cognitive dimensions of notation
* Live language and interface design
* CUIs: Code as live user interface
* Domain specific languages, and the live coding ecosystem
* Programming language experience design: visualising live process and state in code interfaces
* Virtuosity, flow, aesthetics and phenomenology of live code
* Live coding: composition, improvisation or something else?
* Time in notation, process, and perception
* Live coding of and inside computer games and virtual reality
* Live programming languages as art: esoteric and idiosyncratic systems
* Bugfixing in/as performance
* Individual expression in shared live coding environments
* Live coding across the senses and algorithmic synaesthesia
* Audience research and ethnographies of live coding
* Live coding without computers
* Live coding before Live Coding; historical perspectives on live programming languages
* Heritage, vintage and nostalgia â€“ bringing the past to life with code
* Live coding in public and in private
* Cultural processes of live programming language design
* General purpose live programming languages and live coding operating systems
* Connecting live coding with ancient arts or crafts practice
* Live coding and the hacker/maker movement: DIY and hacker aesthetics
* Critical reflections; diversity in the live coding community
* The freedom of liveness, and free/open source software

# Performance submissions

Performance submissions should be in the form of a 1-2 page
description of your piece, together with links to supporting audio or
video, and a technical rider. The rider should state:

* Preferred venue(s) (concert hall, club night, installation space, etc)
* Preferred duration (we're unlikely to be able to schedule
  performances of longer than 20 minutes for day time concerts, and 30
  minutes for the club night)
* Preferred stage layout
* Equipment to be provided by artist
* Equipment to be provided by conference
* Audio outputs / channels
* Video outputs
* Lighting requirements

You are welcome to use the above paper templates, but this is not mandatory for performance submissions. However, please submit your proposal as a PDF file, and via [the same easychair link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclc2015) as for papers. Indicate that your submission is for a performance in the 'other information'.

The following performance venues and opportunities are available.

## Concert hall

Our daytime performances will take place at the [Clothworkers'
Centenary Concert Hall](http://concerts.leeds.ac.uk/), in the School
of Music, University of Leeds.

As standard we will make available a stereo system (Genelec 7070A), an
8 channel system (Genelec 1037B), and a Yamaha Disklavier piano
(possibly two). For microphone list and other equipment enquiries,
please contact the conference organisers.

### CePRA session on Instrumental Collaboration

The Centre for Practive-Led Research in The Arts (CePRA), University
of Leeds are sponsoring the participation of pianist [Anne
Veinberg](http://www.anneveinberg.com/) and percussionist [Paul
Hession](http://www.softdrum.com/), both internationally respected
practitioners. You are warmly encouraged to submit proposals to the
conference for performance collaborations with one (or possibly both!)
of them.

[Anne Veinberg](http://www.anneveinberg.com) is a accomplished pianist
and interdisciplinary practitioner with a history of working with live
coders, performing at the most recent large European live coding event
Live.Code.Fest Karlsruhe 2013, working with composer [Marcel
Wierckx](http://www.lownorth.nl/) as well as forming a duo, "Off<>zz",
with [Felipe Ignacio Noriega](http://www.felipeignacio.info),
dedicated to the combination of piano with live coding.

[Paul Hession](http://www.softdrum.com/) works mostly within the jazz
and free improvisation scenes. Paul has played with many of the great
free improvisers, including Derek Bailey, Evan Parker, Peter
Brotzmann, Joe McPhee and Lol Coxhill as well as musicians from other
spheres, such as Paul Woolford, Squarepusher and live coder Alex
McLean. His recent work has explored extensions of his drum set with
live electronics and live algorithms.

You may contact Anne or Paul directly via their respective website, or
via the organisers at
[livecodenet@gmail.com](mailto:livecodenet@gmail.com).

Performances with Anne would take place in the concert
hall. Performances with Paul could potentially take place in the
algorave or other settings.

You are of course very welcome to submit performance proposals which
include other instrumentalists, in which case we are unable to
contribute towards related costs, but may be able to help with
equipment/instruments.

## Algorave

No academic conference is complete without an
[algorave](http://algorave.com/), a chance to dance to algorithms with friends new and old.

We will have at least one club night, at the excellent [Wharf
Chambers](http://www.wharfchambers.org/) co-op. More details to
follow.

## Installation-based works, headphone works, and 'other'

We are happy to support alternative approaches to presenting live
coded music wherever practical, for example we are able to provide
space for installations, and also headphone amplifiers for up to 100
people. Please get in contact if you would like to discuss your
proposal prior to submission.

# Workshops

As part of the International Conference for Live Coding we are interested in including exciting and diverse workshops/special sessions focusing on particular ideas, methods and themes around live coding. Have you developed a technique, language or a system? Is your work in robotics, graphics, games, dance, installations, performance art, interface design, video art or music using some live coding methods that could be fun to introduce to other people? Would you be interested in involving others in the exploration or even development of your system? Then please submit a 300 word abstract with your proposal for a half-day workshop. This will be the only multi-track part of the conference, and is a good opportunity to focus on a particular technology, community of practice, discipline, or other subtheme.

Describe the space and technical support required for you to run your workshop. We are able to accommodate four parallel workshops, which will take place during 13th of July, the first day of the conference. Please use the "short paper" submission category on [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclc2015) for submitting your workshop. 

If you would like to discuss your workshop idea informally before submitting it, you are encouraged to contact the organisers via [livecodenet@gmail.com](mailto:livecodenet@gmail.com).
