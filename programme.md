We are currently constructing the programme of events, taking place at
the University of Leeds as well as evening venues in the city.

In the meantime, here are the accepted submissions following blind
peer review. The peer review cogs are still turning, and further
papers will be added, as well as special sessions. However, we are
excited to share the emerging programme at the earliest opportunity.
